# LSCI(Laser speckle image system)
During my school years, I conducted a study on the subject 
#### "Development of Laser Speckle Image Projection System for Early Diagnosing Thissue necrosis."
Research suggests that this technology could be used to determine vascular diseases such as arteriosclerosis through microvascular verification. Alternatively, it may be used to determine the extent of the burn victims.
The code is re-opened in the hope that it will be of any reference to students or interested people who conduct research using laser speckle. but if you want to use part of the code, please refer to the license.

## 1. Abstract
Accidents occur frequently, from industrial environments to everyday life, and most of 
them are terminal parts of the body.(such as hands and legs) Damage to these areas 
causes severe dysfunction and requires quick treatment. However, it is very important to 
determine the degree of necrosis of tissue before and after treatment. Currently, only 
magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) method, biopsy and pseudo-observation method are 
determining the necrosis, which are costly, time consuming or unreliable. The necrosis is 
closely related to the flow of blood. So we can make a diagnosis of tissue necrosis to 
observe the flow of blood. The aims of our study is to find a fast and reliable way to use 
a laser speckle contrast imaging(LSCI) system for observing the flow of blood. Also 
enhancing the efficiency and intuition of observation by projecting the observed blood 
flow to the applied area (injury area) using by beam projector. 

## 2. Theorem
Spackle patterns were unintentionally unique during experiments with He-Ne laser in the 1960s.
Because this phenomenon reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), several methods have been developed to eliminate it in the video application field. However, it has been proved to be a very strong metric system in various applications, including material characterization and speed measurement and biomedical applications and voice reconstruction. With respect to biomedical applications, laser spekcle is traditionally used for microcircular imaging in tissues with high blood vessels, such as retina and cerebellum. In addition to this tissue, laser spacles have been used in forearms and hands to study tissue perfusion in the event of external irritation or arterial occlusion.
